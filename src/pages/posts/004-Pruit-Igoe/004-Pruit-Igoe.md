Since the Cyberpunk 2077 fiasco (the most notorious 7/10 game of 2020) I've been watching GTAIV and V comparison videos. Mostly the excellent work by <a href='https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFTjC8OaMv_kP5frj9UU1Rw' target='_blank'>ENXGMA</a>. It takes you back, and brings a humble appreciation for the immense amount of details and craft Rockstar did. They also remained me of a retailer job I had eons ago.</p>

<p>It was at a videogame store: a small closet at an average mall in the City. Being at the other side of the counter always gives you a new perspective. Makes you realize the several degrees of artificial fuckery behind consumerism. Eight hours or more listening to the same four trailers on repeat (GTA IV was about to be released to the public, and by God I still remember every beat, line, sfx, and so on). Confused parents with their preteens asking me about nonviolent content. Your first clueless boss. I didn't last long, and that was fine by me.</p>

That wasn't a bad job at all, but good God it was mind-numbing as hell. We didn't even have the very own basics of gossiping and fucking around, which can (and sometimes will) be a lifesaver in the face of a minimum wage.

At least the people didn't smell funny, compared to other videogame related environments I used to roam before all this quarantined clusterfuck. Not gonna lie, you know me well: complains or not, I do miss those gatherings a lot.
