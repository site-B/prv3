<p>
Picture this. You enter a museum, and start looking a multitude of works. Chances are, human and/or animal figures are represented in a semi realistic technique (meaning they demand less effort to our brains in order to form a more complete understanding of what we're seeing). Where does your attention go first? The overall scene perhaps, the composition?  How about the color palettes, or easily recognizable symbols associated with its author and/or cultural period? 
</p>

<p>I always go for the eyes first. And as long as I can remember, I always did.</p>

<p>I noticed this while I was changing my bedroom's decoration. I switched from Greco's The Nobleman with his Hand on his Chest to Goya's Saturn Devouring His Son, because that's some of the jam I dig behind closed doors too.

While I was looking His eyes, my mind went back to Moscow. To one of the most fascinating, sad, and disturbing works I had the luck to see face to face: Ilya Repin's Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan, from the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow. This was way before the 2018's attack (see featured image for more visual info), when a drunk visitor damaged the painting. The attacker declared this was due to historical inaccuracies. Historians often debate if Ivan Grozny did trully kill his son Ivan Ivanovich. But I digress.</p>

<p>Parallelisms are obvious from a thematic perspective: parents asserting their natural right of dominance through murder of their descendants with extreme prejudice. Eyes in paintings are a direct gateway to our interpretation of what we're looking to, if you allow me a cheap pun. You lock your attention, suppress your initial, subconscious fear, and your mind wanders away. My angle here is nothing but an amalgamation of the aesthetic and social, as the instinct to make eye contact with a potential threat is imperative.</p>

<p>There's a common degree of madness and anxiety in both paternal figures, with the substantial and evident difference that Ivan's expression comes from regret while Saturn lacks any in the name of his frenzied thrive for power. Figures of power beyond any redemption. </p>

<p>I finally chose The Dog. Also, by Goya. Also in his Black Paintings. More ambiguous, less asphyxiating. I mean, I still don't live in a place big and crazy enough to set A Pilgrimage to San Isidro and Witches' Sabbath (The Great He-Goat) face to face (not one next to each other like the display in the Prado Museum).</p>

<p>One man can dream though. </p>
