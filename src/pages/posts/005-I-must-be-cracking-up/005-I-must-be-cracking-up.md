excerpt: Or Perhapts the Next Best Thing

<br>
After one year, many things had changed for good. I miss smoking. I miss social, Irresponsibly immoderated drinking. I miss being mear three or more people without getting worried, paranoid, or worse. Days feel longer when the necessary measures to make everything don't blow up require staying indoors for way longer than usual. <br><br>

Running away is there. The countryside as an alternative is there, a change of scenery at hand, but what's the point. These days most people are just trying to balance working with taking care of their families and not losing their shits altogether. And there hasn't been any period in recent history when losing your shit seems and feels like a sensible and unavoidable reaction to reality.

News and happenings grind your mind, making it malleable towards panic and fear. Conversations with our loved ones become inventories of our worst moments. You can feel the anxiety in people more than ever these days. Dare to talk with anyone and see how long it takes to them, or you or both, to start piling up nothing but worries and fears. Everything else is theatrics and social salad-dressing. 

But there are some exceptions. Some brief, unpredictable moments of wild anarchy through joy. When laugh and a sense of security through acceptance is the only valid reaction. When you stop on your tracks, forget everything for a minute or two, do something childish.

Then return back to normal.

I think I may be cracking up altogether.

And so far I'm enjoying it.
