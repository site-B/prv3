excerpt: How This Blog Has Come To

<br>
Good gravy.
<br><br>

I like what I do these days, but it takes me to unexpected, surreal places. This blog was a small side-project designed as a quick break from a long, sometimes dreaded, React/Redux studying one. Also, an excellent excuse to finally tackle GraphQL, Gatsby, and Bootstrap  through Reactstrap (the first iteration of this blog used styled components, which I like a lot, but I wanted to try something new because reasons). 

Problem is, or virtue depending on your own way of looking things, while GraphQL queries are as precise as demanding, gatsby develop does not check out if every single page (with/without <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/part-seven/" target="_blank">createPages()</a>) is properly working. Gatsby build <em>does that</em>. And for an entire day I got problems with <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-image/" target="_blank">gatsby-image</a>. I thought I was misplacing or misusing them. Or somehow ruined the whole pagination process.

The mistake was so small and overlooked: an incorrectly named file from one, just one, of the markdown files I am using to create posts here. I think I never knew before a human could be able to be baffled and surprised while smiling like someone who has found a new faith. Same as it ever was. 

You should expect frequent updates. I like this system to have a basic, static blog. I like Markdown syntax. 

What now. Maybe Next.js, I do not know yet. <br><br>
