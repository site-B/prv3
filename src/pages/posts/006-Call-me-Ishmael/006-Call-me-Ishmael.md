Regret is not a matter of time. It is a matter of perspective and patience. Sometimes I stumble upon people I haven't spoken to since forever. Five, ten years, most times even more. That's what happens when you're still using a really old email account for work, "important stuff", and other iterations. The search of comfort and stability will take you anywhere, good or bad. 

Everyone looks so much older but good at the same time, is weird. Everything feels so unnatural, compromised, and watered down. Everyone became a walking, breathing, pooping trademark. LinkedIn or any of its equivalents does that to people, mind you. It's an external phenomenon, a direct consequence of the assimilation by the job market and its redundant ramifications.

Everything is success after success. Boring as shit. Moving on. Going to places you used to visit and have fun in. I believe it is a gift to remember the past and not being overwhelmed, depressed, or regretful about it. I believe is a matter of strength more than chance. A choice, built upon few principles and innumerable mistakes. 

Cynicism is always there, predictable predating any act, any thought, any comma. It is the easy way in into an endless conflict where nothing is gained, or learned. Already saw many close ones that cannot stop being nothing but whiny, predictably, innocuous, caustic  shadows of themselves. What happened here, I do not know for sure, but my usual suspicions: they have surrendered to a logic more powerful than reason. Pass. Avoid that mindset like the plague, and pray for those around you who're still stuck in the past. 

There's a beauty in that. In concatenate memory after memory, good or bad, and being able to move on without limping. To face and try to conquer an unshaped beast, bigger than life, faster than any neurological process you can imagine. And then move on, if you're able to. It is a constant reminder, full of grace and pain, of what are the costs of remembering what you cared about. And who you spent some time with.

Every little victory stays there with you. Marked within you, always felt, but unseen.
